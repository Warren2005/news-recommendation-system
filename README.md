# News Recommendation System 

## Introduction 

This project is desgined to specifically help those who get overwhelmed by the large number of information sources present on the internet. I have always been intrigued by the world of tech and that of sports, however, it has been incredibly difficult to find articles in these particular fields without having to go through tons of other articles which I do not find particularly useful. This system frustrated me up to a point where I decided I could use code to obtain articles of my choice specifically and also use Machine Learning to suggest articles which correspond to my interests. This is what I try to achieve in this project by building a model that can supply a variety of articles relevant to my interests and keep me updated on trends around the world. 


## User Stories 

- As a user I want the system to provide me with articles relevant to a given search. 

- As a user I want to see articles automatically suggested when I open the app. 

- As a user I want the model to suggest a list of articles based on previous preferences and choices when I click a suggest button ().
